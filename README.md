# SmartLight Manager

Unofficial iHomma Smart Light Manager

> This is a free (GPLv3), open source replacement for the iHomma HCS Android app (which has now been removed from the store).
> It's a work in progress and does not implements 100% of the smart light's features but it allows to easily control your devices across your network.
  
# Technologies Used

This is an Ionic hybrid application, which means it can be compiled for Android and iOS (and probably others that have not been tested).
  
# What can I do with this?

- Pair a new lamp on my network
- Probe a network for smart devices
- Turn a lamp on/off
- Set a light preset

# What can I not do with this?

- Set an alarm on a smart device
- Control a device with Alexa/Google Home

# How do I use this?

At the moment you have to :

#### Clone the project

`# git clone https://github.com/lp1dev/smartlight-manager.git`

#### Install the dependencies

`# cd smartlight-manager && npm install -g ionic cordova && npm install`

#### Build it for your platform

# Todo

- [ ] screenshots
- [ ] upload on F-Droid
- [ ] upload on Google Play Store
- [ ] Add the missing features

# Notes

I am going to post the app to F-droid and Google Play Store **ASAP** now that the official client has disappeared, which means that people might actually need it soon.
